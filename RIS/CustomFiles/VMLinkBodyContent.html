        RE:  	Value Map
    </p>
    <p>
        Hello $custName$;
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m including a link for you to create your own personal Value Map.  Let me explain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than limit our conversations to “What you’re looking for”, or “What’s important to you” … just like everyone else … I’m going to have you do something a little different.  I’m going to have you create a Shopping and Evaluation Guide. We call it a Value Map.
    </p>
        Since my goal is to help you make the “Most Perfect” decision you can possibly make, I’d like for you to spend 10 to 15 minutes and define what value means to you in a new place to live.  In other words, to define value in terms of your everyday life as you eat, play, work and entertain when interacting with friends, family and acquaintances.
    <p>
        Once you’ve completed your Value Map, we’ll use it in a few of different ways:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
        <li style="margin-left:0in">First … We’ll use YOUR definition of value (Value Map) to make a list of homes that would be good for you to tour.<u></u><u></u></li>
        <li style="margin-left:0in">Second … as we tour each of your favorite properties … we’ll use your Value Map to have YOU compare and decide how well each property matches your definition of Value.<u></u><u></u></li>
        <li style="margin-left:0in">Finally … we’ll use your area, community and property evaluations to sit and discuss your decision options … options based on YOUR definition value.<u></u><u></u></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The link I’m including is a self-guided tour that will lead you through the process.  In the end, the Value Map you are about to complete will virtually:
    </p>
    <ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
        <li style="margin-left:0in">Save you time<u></u><u></u></li>
        <li style="margin-left:0in">Save you money<u></u><u></u></li>
        <li style="margin-left:0in">Reduce the chance of a costly mistake<u></u><u></u></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Thanks again.  I’ll be in touch after you complete your Value Map to confirm the next-step in your shopping process.  Click <a href="$href$">HERE</a> to begin your Value Map Process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sincerely,
    </p>
